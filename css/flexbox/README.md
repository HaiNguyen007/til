# Flexbox
- [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Flexible_Box_Layout/Using_CSS_flexible_boxes)

> A flex container expands items to fill available free space, or shrinks them to prevent overflow.

> Most importantly, the flexbox layout is direction-agnostic as opposed to the regular layouts (block which is vertically-based and inline which is horizontally-based)

> While the block layout works well for pages, it lacks sufficient definition to support application components that have to **change orientation, resize, stretch, or shrink as the user agent changes, flips from vertical to horizontal, and so forth**.
