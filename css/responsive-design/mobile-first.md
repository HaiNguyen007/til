## Mobile first
Because there’s commonly just **20%** of the screen space on mobile that you’d have available on desktop, you have to think about how to utilize the space in an effective manner.

1. Start with a single column approach, with the smallest possible viewport
2. Arrange your content in a linear manner — decide the levels of priority of different parts of your site, and organize the page appropriately (a common approach in landing pages is to divide the page into sections that each describe a different selling point. See the [Paper by 53](https://www.fiftythree.com/paper) mobile site as an example.)
3. Gradually resize your browser up by increasing its width, and figure out the points where the design no longer looks good. That is your next breakpoint!

## Information hierarchy and prioritization
- What is most important to the user?
- What do you want to communicate to the mobile user?
- What are the main actions you want your user to be able to accomplish on the page?

Other questions:
- Who’s going to be using the website?
- In what context will they be using the site most frequently? On the go?
- What features and information do they need to have access to? What’s most essential?
