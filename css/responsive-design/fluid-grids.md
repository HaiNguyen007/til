> `target / context = result`

If we are using a 960px grid (a grid that has a wrapper container of 960px), and we have one column that’s 300px… we can find the percentage dimensions of that column div with the equation 300 / 960 = 31.25% (target / context = result). Instead of applying pixel dimensions to the elements in CSS, now, we'll use the percentage values instead to maintain a fluid layout.
