## Responsive navigation patterns

#### Top Nav
Simply shift your nav links into the header, and do nothing other than adjust padding and margins to make sure that the list items are styled and centered appropriately.

#### Toggle
Another approach is to hide your nav links behind a "menu" toggle — and to slide down the rest of your page’s content when the menu is shown.

#### Side menu / "off-canvas" flyout
You sacrifice discoverability (many users will not even know the menu exists!), and you’ll likely have to build a separate navigation pattern for your desktop version
