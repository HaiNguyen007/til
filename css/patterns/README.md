- Style snippets (vision: inline, React)
  - http://tympanus.net/Tutorials/BasicReadyToUseCSSStyles/

- Rebass
- tether http://github.hubspot.com/
  - react-tether

Tether is a really interesting project that generalizes Dropdown/Tooltip/Dialog/overlayed elements.

I have an idea: To relearn how to build front-end components, build it all by myself, like Rebass
- Also provide options for non-React
  - tutorials/live playground
- Stateful/Stateless (like Uber)
- react-docgen
- Gitbook

React-wheel
