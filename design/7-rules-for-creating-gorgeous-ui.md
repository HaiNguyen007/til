## Rule 1: Light Comes From the Sky
> Shadows are invaluable cues in telling the human brain what user interface elements we’re looking at.

The tops of stuff are lighter, the bottoms are darker.

## Rule 2: Black and White First
Using multiple colors from one or two base hues is the most reliable way to accentuate and neutralize elements without making the design messy.

## Rule 4: Learn the methods of overlaying text on images

#### Method 0: Apply text directly to image
- image should be dark, and not have a lot of contrast-y edges
- text has to be white
- Test it at every screen/window size

Make text legible:
#### Method 1: Overlay the whole image
#### Method 2: Text-in-a-box
Whip up a mildly-transparent black rectangle and lather on some white text
#### Method 3: Blur the image
iOS 7 has really made background blurring a thing
can also use the out-of-focus area of a photo as the blur
#### Method 4: Floor fade
There’s ever-so-subtle a gradient from the middle (black at 0% opacity) to the bottom (black at, ehhhhh maybe ‘bout 20% opacity).

#### Bonus Method: Scrim
A scrim is a piece of photography equipment that makes light softer. Now it’s also a visual design technique for softening an image so overlaid text is more legible.

## Rule 5: Make text pop— and un-pop

## Rule 6: Use Good Fonts
