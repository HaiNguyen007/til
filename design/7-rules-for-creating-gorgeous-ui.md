## Learn the methods of overlaying text on images
- image should be dark, and not have a lot of contrast-y edges
- text has to be white
- Test it at every screen/window size

Make text legible:
#### Method 1: Overlay the whole image
#### Method 2: Text-in-a-box
Whip up a mildly-transparent black rectangle and lather on some white text
#### Method 3: Blur the image
iOS 7 has really made background blurring a thing
can also use the out-of-focus area of a photo as the blur
