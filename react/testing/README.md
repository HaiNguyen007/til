# Testing

`.spec.js` (See examples in https://github.com/jxnblk/rebass/tree/master/test)

Configuring the test runner (either Jest or Mocha) is easy: just make it run the tests in `./src/**/*-spec.js` (See also: [A Better File Structure For React/Redux Applications](http://marmelab.com/blog/2015/12/17/react-directory-structure.html)).
