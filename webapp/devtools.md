# DevTools

You can use DevTools to inspect DevTools itself! (This is how react-object-inspector get developed.)

You can use DevTools to [inspect Chrome apps](chrome://inspect/#apps).

You can use DevTools to inspect many apps to see how they work, like Atom/other electron apps (for treeview, content editing, markdown previewa).
