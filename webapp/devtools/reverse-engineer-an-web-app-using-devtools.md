# Reverse engineer an web app using DevTools

I built `react-inspector` using DevTools on DevTools.

Steps:
- Open the app that needs to be reverse engineered, inspect element
- select element to inspect (to locate precisely)
- copy outer html (in the instance of DevTools, css is embedded)
- Create a index.html (containing the element outer html)
- Open index.html in browser
- Open DevTools to inspect
- Copy styles
